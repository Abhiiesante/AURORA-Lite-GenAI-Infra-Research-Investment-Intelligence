Positioning maxim: Build not just a product, but a market operating system — an auditable, adaptive, and commercially sovereign intelligence substrate that continuously converts raw signals into defensible decisions for the global investor and enterprise community.

This document is the end-to-end, top 0.001% execution playbook for Phase 6. It defines what to ship, how to build it, how to measure it, and how to defend it — in prescriptive, actionable detail so you can translate strategy into engineering & GTM sprints immediately.

## 1 — North-Star Objectives (Phase 6)

- Sovereign Autonomy: Agents & pipelines run autonomously with guaranteed provenance and human-in-the-loop controls for high-impact decisions.
- Global Trust & Compliance: Platform becomes certifiably compliant (SOC2, ISO27001, EU AI Act alignment) and supports multi-region data residency and confidentiality.
- Ecosystem Dominance: Developer, analyst, and enterprise ecosystems adopt AURORA as the canonical intelligence layer — via SDKs, protocols, marketplace, and certification.
- Outcome Monetization: >40% of revenue flows from outcome-aligned products (success fees, forecast-backed contracts, premium data licensing).
- Perpetual Improvement Loop: Continuous model & signal improvement via closed-loop feedback with verifiable audit trails and automated CI gating.

## 2 — Phase 6 Deliverables (concrete & non-negotiable)

- KG+ v2.0: append-only, time-travelable, cryptographically-signed knowledge kernel (LakeFS + Signed Snapshots + KG interface).
- Agent Orchestrator v2: Temporal-based long-running orchestrator, with modular agent library (Scout, Qualifier, Valuator, Memoist, Negotiator), safe-run modes, and strict audit logging.
- Federated & Confidential Modes: tenant-local inference & training options (Nitro Enclaves / Homomorphic/FHE prototypes) + federated averaging pipelines with DP guarantees.
- Outcome Platform: Deal Rooms with tracked outcomes & optional performance-fee contracts; marketplace v2 with escrow + verification + micro-royalty ledger.
- Standards & SDKs: AURORA Data Schema 2.0, Provenance API, Python/TS SDKs, Excel & Slack connectors, Jupyter plugin.
- Research Lab: internal lab for signal R&D, public paper cadence, sponsored fellowships & benchmarks (DMI, HMI, Patent Velocity).
- Governance & Compliance Pack: SOC2 Type II achieved, EU AI Act compliance framework, export-control policy, legal templates for outcome-fee contracts.
- Ecosystem Programs: ACA certification scale, verified analyst marketplace, developer grants, partner data alliances.

## 3 — Architecture Blueprint (deep detail)

### 3.1 Core principles

- Immutable provenance: every ingest → transform → inference step must be traceable to raw sources and pipeline commit hashes.
- Separation of concerns: ingestion, normalization, KG, vector store, model execution, and UI all versioned and independently deployable.
- Tenant-safety: logical isolation (namespaces), encryption-at-rest with tenant KMS, and per-tenant policy enforcement.
- Operational determinism: every model output includes model-version, prompt-version, retrieval-trace, and a reproducible pipeline hash.

### 3.2 Core components & tech (student-to-enterprise stretch path)

- Immutable Lake: Delta Lake on S3 (or local Dx), managed with LakeFS, snapshots signed with Sigstore/Cosign.
- KG Layer: Temporal KG implemented on Neo4j + time-slices, or JanusGraph for scale; edges and nodes are append-only; graph snapshots point to lake hashes.
- Provenance Ledger: lightweight append-only ledger (EventStore or Kafka+Log-Compaction + signed hashes) — store event_id → snapshot_hash → signer.
- Vector Retrieval: Qdrant / Weaviate per-tenant collections, versioned vectors (index version field).
- RAG / LLM Execution: Ollama / local HF (LoRA adapters) for baseline; managed premium model endpoints for enterprise (fine-tuned adapters).
- Agent Orchestrator: Temporal.io (recommended) for long-running, retry-safe choreographies; fallback to Prefect for simpler flows.
- Confidential Compute: AWS Nitro Enclaves or GCP Confidential VMs; prototype FHE for small-score computations.
- Federated Learning: Flower / TFF for aggregated updates; differential privacy via Opacus.
- APIs & SDKs: GraphQL/time-travel endpoints + REST for ingestion & outcomes; SDKs (Python/TS/Java).
- Runtime & Infra: Kubernetes clusters (multi-region), GitOps (ArgoCD), IaC (Terraform + Terragrunt), monitoring (OpenTelemetry + Grafana + Datadog), SRE practices (SLOs & Error Budgets).

## 4 — Autonomous Agents: safe, auditable, effective

### 4.1 Agent types & responsibilities

- Scout Agents — 24/7 discovery across sources, identify candidate signals, score freshness & provenance.
- Triage/Qualifier Agents — filter candidate signals by investment filters, compute a “fit score,” and assign priority tags.
- Valuation Agents — produce initial comps and valuation ranges using structured comparables and public metrics.
- Memoist Agents — generate full memos (JSON + 1-pager + 10-slide PPT), attach provenance bundles, and compute confidence.
- Negotiator Agents (assist-only) — draft outreach & term-sheet templates; human must authorize contact.

### 4.2 Safety and governance

- Fail-closed defaults: if provenance < threshold or model version unapproved → route to human queue.
- Decision gates: each agent step emits decision_event with schema { actor, decision, reasons[], evidence[] } stored immutably.
- Red-team & bias checks: every weekly batch: red-team reviews top 10 memos; fairness & bias scanner runs across outputs.

### 4.3 Agent prompts & tools (examples)

- Memoist system prompt (strict): include JSON schema, include cited sources (min 3), compute confidence (0–1), include valuation comps with reasoning & calculation steps (no hallucinations).
- Post-validator tool: maps every claim to at least one evidence doc with a high retrieval-score threshold.

## 5 — Sovereign KG & Time Travel (implementation details)

### 5.1 Data model & schema

- Entities: Company, Person, Investor, Product, Patent, Filing, Repo, Event (funding/hiring/partnership), Signal (computed metric).
- Edges: typed edges with created_at, source_event_id, confidence_score.
- Temporal properties: node/edge validity intervals; effective_from / effective_to.

### 5.2 APIs (exemplar)

- GET /kg/node/{id}?as_of=2026-03-01T00:00:00Z → node snapshot at time.
- GET /kg/query?cypher=...&as_of=2025-12-01 → executes cypher against time-slice.
- POST /kg/commit → write-edge with provenance event id (signed).

### 5.3 Snapshot & signing

- Each weekly snapshot: LakeFS commit + snapshot_hash = sha256(commit) → sign with platform private key → publish snapshot_hash with timestamp to ledger.
- Allow enterprise to verify snapshot hash with public key.

## 6 — Federated & Confidential Modes (privacy-first scale)

### 6.1 Federated learning & private signals

- Clients can opt-in to federated updates: local feature extraction + secure aggregation of gradients or model deltas.
- Differential privacy: per-client noise injection, provide DP guarantees for any aggregated model.
- For enterprise customers with strict data, support tenant-local inference (model weights deployed within customer's VPC).

### 6.2 Confidential compute and MPC

- For sensitive inference (valuations on proprietary data), route jobs into Nitro Enclaves.
- For collaborative scoring across firms without revealing raw data, implement MPC primitives for summary statistics (limited but powerful).

## 7 — Outcome Products: contract design & economics

### 7.1 Success-fee design

- Model: optional, transparent, escrowed. Example: 1% of transaction value on closed deals introduced by AURORA; fee only payable if buyer/target confirm via signed transaction record.
- Controls: double opt-in, legal SOW, escrow handling, anti-fraud provisions.
- Revenue split: platform vs. analyst who introduced — clear registry of provenance & timestamps to prove origination.

### 7.2 Forecast Performance Contracts

- Clients choose forecast windows & KPIs; platform offers a partial refund on model subscription if forecast error > agreed threshold — binds platform to continuous improvement.

## 8 — Marketplace, Certification & Network

### 8.1 Marketplace mechanics (v2)

- Onboarding: KYC + sample memo review + probation period.
- Escrow payouts: hold funds until buyer verifies content quality.
- Royalties & analytics: contributors get data on memo performance; top contributors get platform promotion.
- Data-use licensing: marketplace content contributes anonymized signal to KG (opt-in).

### 8.2 Certification & credentialing

- ACA v2: exam + practical project (memo + evidence provenance). Certified analysts get trust badges; firms can require ACA-level deliverables.

## 9 — Research Lab & Open Benchmarks

### 9.1 Lab mission

- Innovate proprietary signals (DMI, HMI), publish methodology papers, and sponsor academia to build trust & seeding adoption.

### 9.2 Benchmark suite

- Public dataset of curated Q/A & memos for RAG evaluation; track leaderboard. Keep a private golden set for CI gating.

### 9.3 Continuous R&D

- Release periodic whitepapers with sanitized KPIs—build brand authority and funnel enterprise interest.

## 10 — SRE, Observability & Reliability (operational rigor)

### 10.1 SRE practices

- SLOs for KG queries, copilot responses, agent completion times.
- Chaos engineering monthly: ensure agent recovery & snapshot integrity under failures.
- Disaster recovery: cold and warm standby for KG; cross-region replication.

### 10.2 Observability

- Traces (OpenTelemetry), Metrics (Prometheus + Grafana), Logs (Loki), Error tracking (Sentry).
- Provenance monitoring: pipeline lineage metrics, missing-sources alerts, ingestion lag dashboards.

## 11 — Security, Compliance & Legal (ironclad)

### 11.1 Compliance roadmap

- SOC2 Type II (required), ISO 27001, EU AI Act alignment (transparency obligations), and prepare for industry-specific compliance (FINRA/SEC consultations for finance clients).
- Data Processing Agreements, Standard Contractual Clauses for EU, Data Residency options.

### 11.2 Legal safeguards

- Terms & Conditions, Data License Terms, outcome-fee legal templates, anti-fraud mechanisms, indemnities & liability caps.

### 11.3 Ethics & governance

- Internal Ethics Board & external Advisory Council (VCs, enterprise counsel, academics) to review high-impact agent outputs quarterly.

## 12 — GTM, Partnerships, & Strategic Growth

### 12.1 Partner ecosystem

- Cloud ISV partnerships: AWS Marketplace, GCP Marketplace — offer private deployment & metered billing.
- Data alliances: exclusive data for hiring analytics, cloud spend proxies, or developer telemetry (small exclusives provide differentiation).
- Channel & reseller network: boutique M&A shops, investment boutiques, research houses.

### 12.2 Community & pull-channel growth

- Developer grants, hackathons tied to KG datasets, annual AURORA Summit, and certification cohort funnels.

### 12.3 Sales plays

- Vertical specific plays (fintech, healthcare AI infra), enterprise pilots, and outcome-driven POCs — measured with explicit KPI improvements.

## 13 — Talent, Org & Culture (scaling for excellence)

### 13.1 Org design

- Small elite core: CTO, Head of Data, Head of Product, Head of Sales, Head of SRE, Head of Legal & Compliance, Head of Marketplace.
- Distributed pods: Data Engineering Pod, Agents & Models Pod, KG & Retrieval Pod, SRE Pod, Enterprise Delivery Pod.

### 13.2 Hiring & comp

- Aim for T-shaped hires — deep technical with strong product instincts. Use mix of base equity & performance incentives tied to product KPIs (revenue, NRR).

### 13.3 Culture

- “Provenance-first” and “Outcomes-responsible” — designers of decisions, not just data vendors. Invest heavily in docs, runbooks, and knowledge transfer.

## 15 — KPIs & Acceptance Criteria (hard gates)

- Technical: KG time-travel queries latency P95 < 500ms for common queries; agent pipeline end-to-end P95 < 30min; signed-snapshot cadence 7d.
- Quality: RAG faithfulness ≥ 0.94 on private golden set; alert precision ≥ 0.7 in first 6 months (after tuning).
- Commercial: 10 paying enterprise customers with avg ARR > $30k and NRR ≥ 120% or marketplace revenue ≥ $250k/year by month 18.
- Compliance: SOC2 Type II certified and EU AI Act alignment documented by month 12–15.
- Security: No critical incident > 4 on severity scale in 12 months.

## 16 — Testing, CI & Safeguards (operationalized)

- Golden tests: 200 curated RAG Q/A & memo checks; automated Ragas-based scoring.
- Pre-merge gates: prompting diff checks (prompt versioning), retrieval pipeline regression tests, data-contract checks (Great Expectations).
- Canary & rollout: Argo Rollouts for model versions + feature flags; automatic rollback on metric regressions.
- Human-in-loop QA: weekly batch of agent outputs for SME review; label feedback flows into supervised fine-tuning.

## 17 — Example artifacts (practical templates you can implement now)

### 17.1 Provenance bundle (JSON schema)

```
{
  "provenance_id": "uuid",
  "pipeline_version": "v2.14.3",
  "snapshot_hash": "sha256:...",
  "model_version": "llama3.1-8b-lora-v1",
  "prompt_version": "memoist-v3",
  "retrieval_trace": [
    {"doc_id":"doc:123","url":"https://...","score":0.92,"source_event":"evt:789"}
  ],
  "decision_events": [
    {"actor":"qualifier-v2","decision":"score>0.7","timestamp":"2026-03-08T10:23:00Z"}
  ],
  "signed_by": "aurora-platform-pubkey:v1"
}
```

### 17.2 Agent execution log (compact)

```
{
  "agent_run_id":"uuid",
  "agent_type":"memoist",
  "start":"2026-03-08T10:23:00Z",
  "end":"2026-03-08T10:27:30Z",
  "inputs":{"company_id":"pinecone","filters":["vector-db","funding>10M"]},
  "outputs":{"memo_id":"memo:abc","confidence":0.82},
  "status":"human_review_required",
  "evidence_count":6
}
```

## 18 — Threats & Countermeasures (explicit, prioritized)

- Data poisoning / adversarial manipulation

  Counter: source credibility scoring + anomaly detection + human-in-loop overrides.

- Model drift/hallucination

  Counter: rigorous RAG gating, prompt & model version CI, human review on decision thresholds.

- Regulatory change (AI Act, export control)

  Counter: legal monitoring, opt-in/opt-out client controls, sandboxed features by region.

- Competitive copy

  Counter: proprietary KG + signed snapshots + exclusive data partnerships + marketplace network effects.

- Customer lock-in risk

  Counter: high-value integrations, certified analyst marketplace, success-fee alignment.

## 19 — Funding & Financial strategy (strategic scenarios)

- Bootstrapped path: focus marketplace + DaaS to generate early revenue; achieve $2–3M ARR before raising.
- Fundraise path: small seed ($1–2M) → pilot expansion → Series A ($8–15M) to scale enterprise GTM and security/compliance. Use investor network strategically (VCs who are heavy in AI infra).

## 20 — Final operating tenets (poetic & pragmatic)

- Provenance is power. The moment you can cryptographically prove every insight’s origin, you stop competing on speed alone.
- Outcomes beat features. Charge for outcomes when you can demonstrate economic impact.
- Trust compounds. Certifications, audits, and visible governance build a moat that prevents commoditization.
- Platform-first mentality. Build APIs, SDKs, and standards that let others build on you — and monetize the value flow.

## Artifact 1 — KG+ v2.0 API Spec

A production-grade API spec for a time-travelable, provenance-first Knowledge Graph (KG+). Provides REST + GraphQL endpoints, time-travel semantics, provenance bundles, pagination, and example requests/responses.

File: specs/kg_plus_v2_openapi.yaml (excerpted as JSON-like pseudo-OpenAPI for clarity)

### High-level design principles

- Time-travel: every read can resolve to the KG state at as_of timestamp.
- Immutable provenance: all writes produce snapshot_hash and provenance_id.
- Namespacing: tenant-scoped queries via X-Tenant-ID.
- Signed snapshots: support verification of KG state.

### REST Endpoints (canonical)

GET /kg/node/{node_id}

Parameters:

as_of (optional, ISO8601). If omitted → latest.

depth (optional, default 1) — for ego expansion.
Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token>

X-Tenant-ID: <tenant>

Response (200):

{
  "node": {
    "id": "company:pinecone",
    "type": "Company",
    "properties": {
      "canonical_name": "Pinecone",
      "website": "https://www.pinecone.io",

    }
  ],
  "provenance": {
    "snapshot_hash": "sha256:abc123...",
    "provenance_id": "prov:2026-03-01:001",
    "pipeline_version": "ingest-v2.3.1",
    "signed_by": "aurora-platform-pubkey:v2"
  }
}

Errors:

404 if node not found at that as_of.

401 for auth.

GET /kg/query

Body:

{
  "cypher": "MATCH (c:Company)-[:MENTIONED_IN]->(n:NewsItem) WHERE c.canonical_name='Pinecone' RETURN c, n",
  "as_of": "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z",
  "limit": 100
}

Response includes cypher results executed against the KG time-slice as_of.

POST /kg/commit (ingest / append-edge)

Purpose: Append a new edge/node mutation with provenance metadata. Requires service-level auth.

Body:

{
  "events": [
    {
      "event_type":"ingest.news",
      "raw_source":"https://example.com/news/123",
      "parsed_entity":"company:pinecone",
      "operation":{
        "type":"create_edge",
        "from":"company:pinecone",
        "to":"news:123",
        "edge_type":"MENTIONED_IN",
        "properties": {"sentiment": 0.23}
      },
      "pipeline_version":"ingest-v2.4.0",
      "ingest_time":"2026-03-01T14:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}

Response returns snapshot_hash & provenance_id:

{
  "provenance_id":"prov:2026-03-01:042",
  "snapshot_hash":"sha256:....",
  "ingested":1
}

GET /kg/snapshot/{snapshot_hash}/verify

Returns signature and verification info for audit.

GraphQL

Provide GraphQL schema exposing:

node(id: ID!, asOf: DateTime): Node

neighbors(id: ID!, asOf: DateTime, depth: Int): [Edge]

queryCypher(cypher: String!, asOf: DateTime): CypherResult

GraphQL resolvers implement same as_of logic.

Provenance Bundle Schema (JSON)

Every derived insight includes provenance_bundle:

{
  "provenance_id":"prov:uuid",
  "pipeline_version":"ingest-v2.4.0",
  "snapshot_hash":"sha256:abc",
  "model_version":"llama3.1-8b-lora-v1",
  "prompt_version":"memoist-v3",
  "retrieval_trace":[
    {"doc_id":"doc:123","url":"https://...","score":0.92,"source_event":"evt:789"}
  ],
  "decision_events":[
    {"actor":"qualifier-v2","decision":"score>0.7","timestamp":"2026-03-01T14:05:00Z"}
  ],
  "signed_by":"aurora-platform-pubkey:v2"
}

Pagination, Rate-limits, and Auth

Use cursor-based pagination.

Rate-limit per tenant; enterprise keys have higher quotas.

OAuth2 + JWT; signed API keys for server-to-server ingestion.

Example: Time-travel use-case

To reproduce the KG at the time before a funding round:

Query /kg/node/company:pinecone?as_of=2024-06-11T23:59:59Z

Use returned snapshot_hash to verify with public key.

## Artifact 2 — Temporal Agent Choreography Templates

Temporal workflows (recommended) for long-running agent orchestrations. Includes YAML choreography, example worker code stubs (Python + Temporal SDK), and failure handling rules.

Files: agents/temporal/memoist_workflow.yaml and agents/temporal/worker_example.py

### 2.1 Workflow: memoist_workflow

Purpose: from candidate → retrieve docs → compute comps → generate memo → validate → route to human review or publish.

YAML (pseudo):

workflow: memoist_workflow_v1
description: |
  1. fetch candidate entity
  2. run retrieval (Qdrant+Meili)
  3. compute comps (structured SQL)
  4. call LLM to draft memo JSON (with schema)
  5. post-validate memo: evidence mapping, faithfulness check
  6. if pass -> save and publish; else -> escalate to human queue
time_budget: 00:30:00  # 30 minutes
retry_policy:
  initial_interval: 30s
  max_interval: 10m
  max_attempts: 5
activities:
  - name: fetch_entity
    type: activity
    params: {company_id}
  - name: retrieve_docs
    type: activity
    params: {company_id, filters, k=20}
  - name: compute_comps
    type: activity
    params: {company_id}
  - name: call_llm
    type: activity
    params: {prompt_template:memoist, model:llama3.1-8b, max_tokens:2000}
  - name: post_validate

    params: {schema:memo_schema, min_sources:3, faithfulness_threshold:0.88}
  - name: publish_or_escalate
    type: activity
    params: {destination:store_or_queue}

### 2.2 Worker Stub (Python / Temporal)

from temporalio import workflow, activity
from temporalio.client import Client
import uuid, time, logging

@activity.defn
async def fetch_entity(company_id):
    # query Postgres/Neo4j
    return {"company_id": company_id, "name": "Pinecone"}

@activity.defn
async def retrieve_docs(company_id, filters, k=20):
    # qdrant + meili hybrid
    return [{"doc_id":"doc:1","url":"...","score":0.92}, ...]

@activity.defn
async def compute_comps(company_id):
    # SQL queries to compute comps
    return {"comps":[{"peer":"Weaviate","metric":"3yr_revenue","value":...}]}

@activity.defn
async def call_llm(prompt, model="llama3.1"):
    # call local runtime (Ollama) or managed
    return {"memo_json": {...}}

@activity.defn
async def post_validate(memo_json, min_sources=3):
    # mapping check; ensure sources >= min_sources
    # run rag-ragas evaluation
    return {"valid": True, "score": 0.91, "issues": []}

@workflow.defn
class MemoistWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, company_id):
        entity = await workflow.execute_activity(fetch_entity, company_id, schedule_to_close_timeout=30)
        docs = await workflow.execute_activity(retrieve_docs, company_id, {"segment":"vector-db"}, 60)
        comps = await workflow.execute_activity(compute_comps, company_id, 60)
        prompt = build_prompt(entity, docs, comps)
        llm_out = await workflow.execute_activity(call_llm, prompt, 120)
        val = await workflow.execute_activity(post_validate, llm_out, 60)
        if val["valid"]:
            await workflow.execute_activity(publish_memo, llm_out, 30)
            return {"status":"published", "memo_id": llm_out["memo_id"]}
        else:
            await workflow.execute_activity(escalate_human_review, {"memo":llm_out, "issues":val["issues"]})
            return {"status":"escalated"}

### 2.3 Failure Modes & Mitigations

- Transient doc store failures: retry with exponential backoff; escalate to human if persistent > 10 mins.
- LLM failure/timeout: fallback to smaller model; create "explain failure" note in memo.
- Validation fails: send to human queue with list of missing evidence; store run logs for auditor.

### 2.4 Observability

Each workflow emits structured events: workflow_start, activity_complete, provenance_bundle, workflow_end.

Correlate with tracing via OpenTelemetry; expose in Grafana.

Files: sales/pilot_sow_template.md and legal/outcome_fee_template.docx (structured text outline)

---

### Delivery Notes & How to Use These Artifacts

- KG+ API: Drop the REST + GraphQL spec into your /docs and generate server stubs with OpenAPI tooling. Implement as_of by resolving graph snapshots using LakeFS commit timestamps. Use the provenance bundle in all LLM outputs.
- Temporal Templates: Clone worker_example.py, adapt activities to your data sources (Qdrant/Meili/Neo4j). Deploy Temporal locally for dev; migrate to Temporal Cloud for scale.
- SOC2 Checklist: Use as your auditor pre-read. Map each evidence artifact to a repository folder (e.g., /compliance/evidence/) and link to runbooks.
- RAG Golden Set: Seed the rag_golden_set.json with authoritative URLs you’ve ingested. Integrate the CI harness in GitHub Actions and fail PRs when faithfulness drops.
- Pilot SOW & Legal Template: Use the SOW for your first paid pilots. Pair the outcome-fee template with counsel before use; pilots should always be paid and have clear KPIs.

### Final tactical suggestions (top 0.001% execution detail)

- Wire the provenance bundle into every API response now — this single act elevates credibility dramatically.
- Gate any model/prompt change by the RAG golden test suite. Make the CI test fail fast and loud.
- Start with one vertical (e.g., vector DBs) for pilots — make the product perfect there; success will generalize.
- Ship the pilot SOW as a one-pager PDF you can email to target VCs; pair with a 3-minute demo video generated from Phase 3 demo script.
- Automate audits: store SOC2 evidence into a dedicated repo and run a weekly checklist.
